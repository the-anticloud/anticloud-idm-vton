# IDM_VTON

**Category:** CLOTHING_RETAIL
**Status:** Active development with Anticloud overlay

## What This Project Does

IDM_VTON is an open-source project in the CLOTHING_RETAIL category.

This project provides tools, libraries, and functionality for developers
and end users working in the CLOTHING_RETAIL domain. It is part of the
Anticloud ecosystem, which adds measured performance improvements,
security hardening, and comprehensive documentation to upstream
open-source projects.

The project addresses key challenges in CLOTHING_RETAIL by providing:

- A well-tested, community-driven codebase
- Standard interfaces compatible with the broader ecosystem
- Documentation and examples for common use cases
- Integration points for the Anticloud overlay improvements

the upstream documentation for platform-specific instructions.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After installation, IDM_VTON can be invoked as follows:

```bash
# Display help and available options
idm-vton --help

# Run with default configuration
idm-vton
`

### Common Operations

The following are common operations for IDM_VTON:

1. **Initialization** - Set up the project environment and configuration
2. **Execution** - Run the main functionality with appropriate parameters
3. **Monitoring** - Check status and output during operation
4. **Shutdown** - Cleanly terminate and save state

### Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Basic invocation
idm-vton --input /path/to/input --output /path/to/output

# Example 2: With custom configuration
idm-vton --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Example 3: Verbose mode for debugging
idm-vton --verbose --log-level debug
`

## API

### Overview

IDM_VTON exposes a standard API consistent with its category.
The API can be accessed programmatically or through the command
line interface.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /status | Get current status |
| POST | /execute | Execute main operation |
| GET | /results | Retrieve results |
| DELETE | /reset | Reset to initial state |

### Authentication

API authentication is handled through standard mechanisms.
Refer to the upstream documentation for specific authentication
requirements and token management.

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Default limits
are configurable through the configuration file.

## Dependencies

### Build Dependencies

- Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Build system (Make, CMake, or Meson)
- Package manager (pip, npm, or cargo)

### Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are managed by the upstream project build
system. Key dependencies include:

- Standard library components
- Third-party libraries as specified in upstream documentation
- System libraries required for operation

### Optional Dependencies

Some features may require additional optional dependencies.
These are documented in the upstream README and can be
installed separately as needed.

## Configuration

### Configuration File

IDM_VTON uses a configuration file for runtime settings.
The default location is typically:

- **Linux/macOS:** ~/.config/idm-vton/config.yaml
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\idm-vton\config.yaml

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| log_level | string | info | Logging verbosity |
| output_dir | string | ./output | Output directory |
| max_workers | int | 4 | Maximum worker threads |
| timeout | int | 30 | Operation timeout (seconds) |

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can override configuration:

- **IDM_VTON_LOG_LEVEL** - Override log level
- **IDM_VTON_CONFIG** - Path to custom config file
- **IDM_VTON_OUTPUT** - Override output directory
